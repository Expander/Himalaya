Himalaya 2.0.0
==============

New features
------------

 * The 3-loop O(at*as^2) contribution to the CP-even Higgs mass matrix
   in the MSSM is now calulated in the DR'-bar scheme by default.
   Shifts to the MDR'-bar and H3m schemes are provided separately.

 * The 3-loop O(at*as^2) contribution to quartic Higgs coupling Î» of
   the Standard Model is calculated in the DR'-bar scheme.  A shift to
   the MS-bar scheme is provided separately.

 * A Mathematica interface for Himalaya has been added.  See README.md
   for a usage example.


Changes
-------

 * The default renormalization scheme for the input parameters has
   been changed to DR'-bar.


Himalaya 1.0.1
==============

Improved debug output.


Himalaya 1.0
============

This is the initial release of the Himalaya library.  The Himalaya
library calculates the 3-loop O(at*as^2) contribution to the CP-even
Higgs mass matrix in the MSSM in the DR-bar or MDR-bar scheme, given a
set of MSSM DR-bar input parameters.
